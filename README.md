# Astar-algo
this is a app that will find the shortest route between two points with obstacles. 

To use download and run it (you'll need pygame) 

This uses the A* algorithm which compares nodes and their neighbors and how far they are from the end point and adds it to how far they've come to get a score that is used to determine the shortest route.

To clear the board hit c to start after you've made endpoints and drawn barriers hit space.
